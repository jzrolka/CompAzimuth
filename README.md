# CompAzimuth
Finding straight line POI on a map by shooting an azimuth from a matrix then, converting it to html.

What I'm trying to say is that I would have to collect a detailed map with Points of Interest (POI.)
Take that map and orient it to a certain degree according to physical positioning of self, Shoot an
azimuth, then take the degree of said shot azimuth and produce POI in straight line of site of the azimuth. e.g. (landmarks;
cities; buildings; farms etc.)

The map can remain old for quite sometime and be updated in intervals of years. Good idea huh?
